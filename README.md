# Introduction to Web Programming - Course Project

For the course project I made a game called "Tauno's Adventure". It is a simple platformer game.

## Credits 
Tauno (character) art made by [@fazzypanda](https://www.instagram.com/fazzypanda/). It was made in 2021 for an old game project we worked on together that never got finished, so I repurposed the character art from that game with the permission from @fazzypanda.

All other stuff not mentioned here is my own work. Although some of my own art may have taken inspiration from some mario games
